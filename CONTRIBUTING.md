# Contributing

Be sure to adhere to our [code of conduct].

## Discussions

Start a discussion if you have a question or idea but are unsure if it fits the
purpose of this project.

## Issues

Create an issue if you found a problem with this project and would like that we
fix it.

## Pulls

Create a pull if you want to make changes to this project, note that, unlike
many other projects, we do not require a discussion or issue before a pull can
be requested. However, there is no guarantee that the pull is merged if it was
not agreed before that the change is useful and aligned with the vision of the
project. It is thus recommended starting a discussion or opening an issue before
spending hours on big changes that might get rejected later. It is still fine to
directly go for a pull request if you want the learning experience.
