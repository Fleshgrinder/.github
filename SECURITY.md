# Security

I take security issues seriously, for all source code repositories in my GitHub organization. Do not hesitate to reach
out if you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any repository of mine.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to me directly via [security@fleshgrinder.com](mailto:security@fleshgrinder.com). You may
use my [PGP key](https://keybase.io/fleshgrinder/pgp_keys.asc?fingerprint=ebe5ebc0f49e38a69fc7ea267366ae4a67748172) to
encrypt your message.

## Preferred Languages

Either German or English is fine.
